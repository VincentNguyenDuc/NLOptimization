Numerical methods for Nonlinear Regression Optimization

## Gauss-Newton Method

- Gauss-Newton Method can be utilised to solve Nonlinear Least-squares problem. However, the algorithm may diverged if the initial point is not suitable.

- One way to guarantee its convergence is to perform a **line search** to find a good learning rate (between 0 and 1) instead instead of using unit learning rate
